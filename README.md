# SQL Khan Academy Course
This repository contains my solutions to the Khan Academy SQL course. The course is freely available [here](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/sql).

This course supplemented my prior experience with query languages and served as a formal introduction to SQL. The course is broken into 4 separate lessons:
1. SQL basics
2. Advanced queries
3. Relational queries
4. Modifying databases

The course uses a browser implementation of SQLite.
