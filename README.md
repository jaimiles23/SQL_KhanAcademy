# SQL Khan Academy Course
This repository contains my solutions to the freely available [Khan Academy SQL course](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/sql). The course supplemented my prior experience with query languages and served as a formal introduction to SQL.

The course is structured into 4 lessons:
1. SQL basics
2. Advanced queries
3. Relational queries
4. Modifying databases

All solutions use a browser implementation of SQLite.
